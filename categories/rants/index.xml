      <description>My friends either did not know that my birthday was on the 17th of June or they forgot. I don&amp;rsquo;t blame them for that. Everyone must be busy, that&amp;rsquo;s all. But I don&amp;rsquo;t know, It hurts so much. Even my relatives forgot my birthday - they&amp;rsquo;re the only ones to greet me since I don&amp;rsquo;t have close friends or friends - just acquaintances.
I was really looking forward that someone would greet a happy birthday.</description>

      <description>Oftentimes, I find myself desperate for attention, hoping that anyone would notice me.As I recall in my childhood, I&amp;rsquo;ve been pleasing people most of my life. I will literally do anything in my power not to disappoint anyone. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s some person that wants their laptop check, or helping with their coding problems, I will go to your place. Not the opposite. I know, that really sucks but it is what it is.</description>
