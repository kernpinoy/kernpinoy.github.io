        <description>&lt;img src="https://kernpinoy.github.io/p/on-birthdays-and-stuffs.../pexels-polina-tankilevitch-7337117.jpg" alt="Featured image of post On birthdays and stuffs..." /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My friends either did not know that my birthday was on the 17th of June or they forgot. I don&amp;rsquo;t blame them for that. Everyone must be busy, that&amp;rsquo;s all. But I don&amp;rsquo;t know, It hurts so much. Even my relatives forgot my birthday - they&amp;rsquo;re the only ones to greet me since I don&amp;rsquo;t have close friends or friends - just acquaintances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really looking forward that someone would greet a happy birthday.
They made me care about birthdays. Because everyone seems to be happy. But it&amp;rsquo;s the same experience. The same ordeal that I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through most of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know their birthdates. I know them because I care about them. That&amp;rsquo;s why I know them. Because they are dear to my heart. This is my first interaction with the outside world since exiting a cult that robbed me of my childhood. Leaving me slow in comprehending the real world. Because they were busy fencing my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s OK, it&amp;rsquo;s just a birthday. They&amp;rsquo;re busy. They have their own life. They have their shit together. I think I&amp;rsquo;m just envious of them. They get greetings all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhoo, that&amp;rsquo;s something I am pondering on.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://kernpinoy.github.io/p/what-am-i-doing-wrong/pexels-pixabay-47090.jpg" alt="Featured image of post What am I doing wrong?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, I find myself desperate for attention, hoping that anyone would notice me.As I recall in my childhood, I&amp;rsquo;ve been pleasing people most of my life.
I will literally do anything in my power not to disappoint anyone. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s some person that wants their laptop check, or helping with their coding problems,
I will go to your place. Not the opposite.
I know, that really sucks but it is what it is. I do not want my friends to be burdened by inconvenience. I guess I have to take it up to my ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you need to know first. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a part of a cult since my childhood. Most of my &amp;lsquo;friends&amp;rsquo; were the children inside their, which I grew up with, basically.
I did not make connections to the outsiders, indoctrinating me with the belief it is better to be friends with people inside the church than the outsider.
The rationale behind this is that insiders are more trustworthy. As I view this now, this only builds a fence to a child that further isolates, enabling deeper brainwashing.
Having said that, I&amp;rsquo;ve left the cult and was doing pretty fine in the early days. Not anymore. Connecting with friends was great, until it shattered. It killed me since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the remnants of that friendship, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed something. I hope I am wrong. Please let me be wrong. I want to be wrong on this observation.
While I trusted them, it seems that they have not done the same. I think nobody really trusted me in the first place.
I mean, they did not even  I think I am just being used. I&amp;rsquo;m not smart in any way possible, let&amp;rsquo;s be clear that out.
I&amp;rsquo;m the regular, most basic bitch, and the most annoying person you&amp;rsquo;ll meet in your existence.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;m just stressed or whatnot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I always remember Slavoj Žižek&amp;rsquo;s interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with Sophocles: the greatest luck is not to have been born
but, as the joke goes on, very few people succeed in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Slavoj Žižek&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to be proven wrong. They&amp;rsquo;re blameless. They&amp;rsquo;re kind to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that the best course of action is to do nothing. Fuck myself and my life.&lt;/p&gt;
